## Simple blockchain implementation using Java

Blockchain including PoW before adding blocks and mining with a simple REST API interface for interaction with the blockchain.
Node discovery and consensus also implemented.

### Improvements to be done in the future (if time lol)

* Add merkle tree implementation for transactions
* Add tests
